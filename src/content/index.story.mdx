# Auto Trader Design System

## What is ATDS?

A design system, is the systemisation of design and so Auto Trader Design System is our latest attempt of doing just that.

While we've shared bits in the past: We previously has a shared design library, _Sparkplug_ gave us shared styles and _Chassis_ gave us a shared component library. This latest evolution is attempting to bring design and code closer together and focus on use cases for design patterns.

_It's both code and design_
