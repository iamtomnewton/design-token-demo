# Button

## Summary

The button component helps users to carry out an action. At this point in their journey, users are often making a choice.

## Examples

### Primary button

Primary buttons should only appear **once** per container / component scope. But can appear more than once per page depending on the context of use.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Primary"
    args={{
      label: "Primary button",
      displayType: "primary",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Secondary button

Use secondary buttons for the next most important actions. If you find you are adding multiple secondary buttons to a screen, it could be a sign that you should simplify the page or break the content down across multiple pages.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Secondary"
    args={{
      label: "Secondary button",
      displayType: "secondary",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Button} />
