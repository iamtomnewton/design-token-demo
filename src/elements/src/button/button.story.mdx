# Button

## Summary 

The button component helps users to carry out an action. At this point in their journey, users are often making a choice. 

You'll often find them throughout the UI in places like:

* Landing pages
* FPAs
* Onboarding journeys
* Forms
* Modals
* Cards

You can place icons next to text labels to both clarify an action and call attention to a button. Use icons that clearly communicate their meaning.

## Examples

### Primary button

Primary buttons should only appear __once__ per container / component scope. But can appear more than once per page depending on the context of use.

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Primary"
    args={{ 
      label: 'Primary button',
      displayType: 'primary',
  }}>
  {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Secondary button

Use secondary buttons for the next most important actions. If you find you are adding multiple secondary buttons to a screen, it could be a sign that you should simplify the page or break the content down across multiple pages.

<Canvas>
  <Story 
    name="Secondary"
    args={{ 
      label: 'Secondary button',
      displayType: 'secondary',
  }}>
  {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
